# About SolarSim (Roblox Description)
This game simulates the formation of a solar system. At its core is a realistic physics engine that utilizes CFrame to accurately simulate orbital mechanics.

Update 0.7.1 fixed some menu glitches and adjusted mass distribution of the system.
Update 0.7.0 added physics and variation to stars; the temperature of your system will determine what type of star you get. Look at the star closely, and you will see it wobble from the gravitational effects of other objects.

Click on objects in the system to view their attributes.

The game is fairly resource-intensive, and it is suggested that this game is played on something other than a typewriter.
